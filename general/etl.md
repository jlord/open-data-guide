#ETL tools

##What is ETL
ETL stand for Extract, Transform, Load and is set of tools or processes around doing exactly that:

* _Extracting_ the data from someplace (usually a database)
* _Transform_ the data from the format that it started into a different format
* _Load_ the data someplace (usually a different database)

##ETL Options

###Buy
There are several ETL tools on the market, some of them open source. When evaluating, in addition to cost and ease of integration, ensure that you evaluate support. Particularly with open source tools, look at the size of the community around the tools as they will be the ones maintaining the base software, as well as possibly helping your team with their technical questions. 

Some options:
* Talend
* Pentaho
* Informatica
* CloverETL
* KETL

###Build
Write your own series of scripts to do ETL - this is not recommended if you do not have a technical team that can develop and support these scripts.
