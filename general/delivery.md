#Data Delivery methods

##File downloads
 This delivery method is good for data that does not change often or is historical data bundled into discrete snapshots. Please don't use this for real-time data. Options include:  
 * 3rd party 'data commons' sites
 * FTP (and variants)
 * BitTorrent

##API
 This is best for real-time data.

##Data Portal
 Can wrap either an API, a set of file downloads, or both.
