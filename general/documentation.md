#Documentation

Documenting the data that you release is arguably as important as releasing it in the first place.

##Document the data
Metadata, where it was sourced from, what is is inclusive up, what it is missing (sampled records? sampled fields?)

##Document the format
This is way easier if you're using a standard

##Document the delivery mechanism
If it's a flat file mechanism, explain that in detail with step by step instructions.

###API
If it's an API document the API as well as possible.
